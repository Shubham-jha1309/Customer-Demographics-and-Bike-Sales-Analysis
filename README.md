# Customer-Demographics-and-Bike-Sales-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a bike sales dataset by cleaning 111 duplicate records and transforming age data into brackets. Using Excel, I created pivot tables to assess average income per purchase, count of bikes bought by commute distance, and age bracket. Interactive slicers for Marital Status, Region, and Education were added.
